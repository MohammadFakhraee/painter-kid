    <string name="about_painter_kid_0">About Painter Kid</string>
    <string name="about_painter_kid_1">
        Children between 2-8 years old are the main users of the app. In this app we tried our best to take one short but calculated step in order to fill children free times and make them familiar with English language. As you might understood till now, the app will say the name of the paint alongside listening to awesome music and coloring the paints in order to learn the English equals of the paint. Our aim by making this paint is filling children free times and helping them say the correct pronunciation.
        \nIf we receive good feedback from you dear parents, we certainly know that we are choosing the correct road and in our future products we will do better and bigger activities which help children around the world to learn English. Hope your kid enjoys the app.

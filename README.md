# painter-kid
Second released project.

This is a painting app which targets children between 3-7 years old. There are some categories such as Fruits, Musics, Animals, etc. Each categori has up to 12 black and white paints. Kids can select their favorite category and paint, then start painting it witch 12 different colors and 4 types of brushes. Painter Kid also aims to teach children English in which they can understand what paint's name is.

Some of the categories in this app are locked which users can buy with in-app purchase feature using CafeBazaar application.
## Motivation
This application was my project in Advanced Android Programming course in 7Learn. I developed the android app on my own and the graphical design such as UI, icon and paints. After releasing the app, more than 1000 people downloaded it.

The aim of building this project was to practice android's graphical feature so I could learn how graphics work in android, how to implement painting, and how to work with Paint, Path, Canvas, Bitmap and etc.

## What I learned
It is my first android app which I focused on learning and using advanced feeatures. Here are some of the things I did:
- Used Java as developing language
- Worked on graphical painting and learned about custom views, Paint, Path, Canvas, Bitmap and their properties
- Used MVVM as the app's architecture
- RxJava2 for its asynchronous feature
- Used EventBus for event-based jobs
- Lottie library for some animations
- Used gifs, paints, voices, multi language support, and font support.
